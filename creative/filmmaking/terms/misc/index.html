</ul>
<h2>substitution splice / stop trick / stop motion substitution</h2>
<ul>
<li>a cinematic special effect in which an appearance, disappearance, or transformation is created using a cut</li>
<li>(Although sometimes called stop trick / stop motion substitution, the effect achieved through film editing rather than by literally stopping the camera.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>compositing</h2>

<h2>match cut / graphic match / raccord (fr.)</h2>
<ul>
<li>the opposite of a jump cut</li>

</ul>
<h2>jump cut</h2>
<ul>
<li>the opposite of a match cut</li>
<li>a cut in which two sequential shots of the same subjects are taken from camera positions that vary only slightly</li>

<li>gives the effect of jumping forward in time</li>
</ul>
<h2>axial cut</h2>
<ul>
<li>a type of jump cut, where the camera suddenly moves closer to or further away from its subject, along an invisible line drawn straight between the camera and the subject</li>

<ul>
<li>a technique in which the camera is stationary and rotates in a vertical plane (tilting plane)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>mise en scène = "putting-in-the-scene"</h2>
<ul>
<li>refers to what is colloquially known as "the Set", but is applied more generally to refer to everything that is presented before the camera to produce intended effects, as opposed to editing (which taked place afterwards), e.g.: the direction of actors, placement of cameras, choice of lenses, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>dolly zoom / reverse tracking shot / stretch shot / contra-zoom</h2>
<ul>
<li>an unsettling in-camera effect that appears to undermine normal visual perception</li>

</li>
<li>or: trans-trav (in Romanian and Russian) from trans-focal length operation and traveling movement</li>
</ul>
<h2>forced perspective</h2>
<ul>
<li>a technique which employs optical illusion to make an object appear further away, closer, larger, or smaller than it actually is. It manipulates human visual perception through the use of scaled objects and the correlation between them and the vantage point of the spectator or camera.</li>
</ul>
<h2>head shot / headshot</h2>
<ul>
<li>a specific type of portrait that realistically demonstrates a person's appearance</li>
</ul>
<h2>money shot / money-making shot</h2>

<h2>reaction shot</h2>
<ul>
<li>a shot which cuts away from the main scene in order to show the reaction of a character to it</li>
</ul>
<h2>trunk shot</h2>
<ul>
<li>a camera angle which captures film from inside the trunk of a car, a specialized type of low-angle shot, the camera can be placed inside the trunk, but this is usually difficult because of its size, so the art department usually fabricates a trunk door and some of the trunk frame into the shot to achieve a comparable effect</li>
</ul>
<h2>walk and talk</h2>
<ul>
<li>a storytelling-technique in which a number of characters have a conversation en route</li>
<li>variations include interruptions from other characters and walk and talk relay races, in which new characters join the group and one of the original characters leaves the conversation, while the remaining characters continue walking and talking</li>
</ul>
<h2>stalker vision / monster vision</h2>
<ul>
<li>a technique used to convey a sense of being watched, it includes: a clear sense of distance between the viewpoint and the subject, often cover is shown to demonstrate that the stalker is hiding, it usually shows an everyday action that is not usually public, the victim is being watched over a period of time, telescopes/ binoculars/ other observation equipment may be used, combined with a treestand or other place for watching</li>
</ul>
<h2>hanging miniature</h2>
<ul>
<li>an in-camera special effect similar to the matte shot where a model, rather than a painting, is placed in foreground and the action takes place in the background, a specific form of forced perspective</li>
</ul>
<h2>matte</h2>
<ul>
<li>used to combine two or more image elements into a single, final image, usually used to combine a foreground image (actors, set) with a background image (a scenic vista / a field of stars and planets / etc. painted on a canves / etc. = the matte)</li>
</ul>
<h2>single-camera setup / single-camera mode of production / Portable Single Camera</h2>
<ul>
<li>a single camera is employed on the set and each shot to make up a scene is taken indepenedently</li>
<li>an alternative method that actually uses two cameras is more widely used: intended to save time by using one camera to capture a medium shot of the scene while the other can capture a close-up during the same take</li>
<li>it remains the standard mode of production in the cinema</li>
</ul>
<h2>multiple-camera setup / multiple-camera mode of production / multi-camera / multicam</h2>
<ul>
<li>several cameras are employed on the set and simultaneously record or broadcast a scene, often used in television and an essential part of live television, generally the two outer cameras shoot close-up shots or "crosses" of the two most active characters on the set at any given time, while the central camera(s) shoot a wider master shot to capture the overall action and establish the geography of the room</li>
</ul>
<h2>cross-cutting</h2>
<ul>
<li>an editing technique most often used to establish action occouring at the same time in two different locations, but the two actions are not necessarily simultaneous, used to build suspense or to show the relationship between the different sets of action</li>
<li>(this term is used synonymously but somewhat incorrectly with parallel editing)</li>
</ul>
<h2>match moving / camera tracking / motion tracking / camera solving</h2>
<ul>
<li>a cinematic technique that allows the insertion of computer graphics into live-actions footage with correct position, scale, orientation, and motion relative to the photographed objects in the shot</li>
<li>the term is used loosely to describe several different methods of extracting camera motion information from a motion picture, sometimes confused with motion capture, which records the motion of objects/ actors rather than the camera</li>
</ul>
<h2>cutaway shot</h2>
<ul>
<li>the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else, it is usually (although not always) followed by a cut back to the first shot (when the cutaway avoids a jump cut, does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own but is used to jelp the editor assemble a longer sequence, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action (e.g. another action or object in the same location)</li>
<li>cutaway scene<ul>
<li>similarly, the interruption of a scene with the insertion of another scene (generally unrelated or only peripherally related to the original scene)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>insert</h2>
<ul>
<li>a shot of part of a scene as filmed from a different angle and/or focal length from the master shot, covers action already covered in the master shot (whereas a cutaway shot covers action <em>not</em> covered by the master shot) but emphasizes a different aspect of that action due to the different framing, the term "insert" is often confined to views of objects and body parts other than the head, often done separately from the main action by a second-unit director using stand-ins, care must be taken to preserve continuity by keeping the objects in the same relative position as in the main take and having the lighting be the same (this also applies to cutaways)</li>
</ul>
<h2>fast cutting</h2>
<ul>
<li>a film editing technique which refers to several consecutive shots of a brief duration (e.g. 3 seconds or less), e.g. uses: imply energy/ chaos/ etc., dialogues</li>
</ul>
<h2>slow cutting</h2>
<ul>
<li>a film editing technique which uses shots of long duration, (though it depends on context:) it is estimated that any shot longer than ~15 seconds will seem rather slow to viewers from Western cultures</li>
</ul>
<h2>L cut / split edit</h2>
<ul>
<li>an edit transition from one shot to another where the transition in the picture and in the sound is not at the same time, often done to enhance aesthetics or flow of the film, also used to hide transitions between scenes, very effective in editing dialogue scenes, allows for the sound of the vatious takes (/ the take with the best reading) to flow smoothly even though the picture cuts are in different places</li>
</ul>
<h2>smash cut</h2>
<ul>
<li>a technique where one scene abruptly cuts to another for aesthetic, narrative or emotional purpose, usually at a crucial moment in a scene where a cut would not be expected, to heighten its impact: a disparity in the type of scene on either side of the cut is often present (fast-paced → tranquil, pleasant → tense), possible to use for comedic effect (e.g. after a prediction → the actual event)</li>
</ul>
<h2>day for night</h2>
<ul>
<li>a set of techniques used to simulate a night scene while filming in daylight, e.g. the scene is underexposed in-camera or darkened during post-production with a blue tint added, employed if it is too difficult/ expensive to actually shoot during nighttime, less common in recent years</li>
</ul>
<h2>high-concept</h2>
<ul>
<li>a pitch-driven project idea with an appeal obvious from its premise or logline</li>
<li><p>five requirements (all mandatory, descending importance):</p>
<ol>
<li>your premise should be original and unique</li>
<li>your story has to have mass audience appeal</li>
<li>your pitch has to be story-specific</li>
<li>the potential is obvious</li>
<li>your pitch should be one to three sentences long</li>

<li>there may or may not be an explicit borderline</li>
<li>before digital technology: combine two actions filmed with an optical printer onto the same negative = the composite, also a technique that allows one actor to appear twice in a scene</li>
</ul>
<h2>screen direction</h2>
<ul>
<li>(in editing &amp; post-production), the direction that actors or objects appear to be moving on the screen from the point of view of the camera or audience</li>
