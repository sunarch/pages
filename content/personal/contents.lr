### C

- [enigmatic](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/enigmatic) - an Enigma emulator
- some testing for the [KIAVC](https://github.com/sunarch/f_lm_kiavc.git) game engine by [Lorenzo Miniero](https://github.com/lminiero) (SDL)

### Lua

> Used for embedded scripting in many places and fits that purpose well. I've used it with Tabletop Simulator and KIAVC.

## languages: tried

### OCaml

> Excellent FP option, I like the language itself very much. The tooling, though, feels cumbersome.

- [hexflush](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/hexflush) - hex dump utility

### Nim

> The syntax is usually said to be "as easy as Python", but it's more smaller things I appreciate about it, e.g. how it distinguished func/proc types. Compiling to C makes it also performant and the tooling has some nice helpful options. However, I want to get away from exceptions (as opposed to errors as values) and there is also some hidden complexity that I wasn't excited to reach.

- [draftable](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/draftable) - document draft visualization (preA)
- [placeholder](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/placeholder) - more fun placeholder texts (preA)
- [unclewed](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/unclewed) - a [Clew](https://clew.se) DB-dump analysis tool (preA)

### Go

> An earned reputation for ease of use, especially for web infrastructure. I don't particularly like some of the syntax and conventions, and I also prefer other directions for personal projects, but I wouldn't object to writing in it.

- [Pixels](https://codeberg.org/sunarch/pixels) - community canvas by API (preA)
